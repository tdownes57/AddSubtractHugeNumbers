     How Do I Work with MS Excel & the Generate Numbers utility?   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   Highlight the numbers in MS Excel you want to process.

2.   Open the Generate Numbers utility.  

3.   In the Main window, press the button which represents your needs, to open a processing window.  

4.   Press the button "Paste" to place your data into the Input box on the processing window. 

5.   Press the button ">>>>>" to start the processing.   

6.   Wait for processing to complete.

7.   Press the button that says "Copy Output". 

8.   Return to MS Excel.  

9.  Find a blank column (or, a group of adjacent blank columns) that are free of any data which will be overwritten by the next step.   

10.   Select the cell of the 1st or 2nd row of the left-hand most column, in the group of blank columns. 
       (By "the 1st or 2nd row", I mean whichever row contains the row of Printed Numbers (i.e the data you choose to copy-paste into the Generate Numbers utility.) 

11.  (a) Hit the "Paste" button.  (b) Review that the data-set aligns row-by-row with the input data which you copied in Step #1 above.  

12.  (a) Similar to #9 above, select a nearby blank column.  
       (b) Create the Excel formula to remove the character-data prefix (probably an underscore or single quote-mark).     
                  =Mid( [Column of Reported Numbers], 1, 100) 
       (c) Copy the Excel formula to all applicable cells (i.e. rows) of the blank column.  

13.  Review the column of data created in #12.   Does it align row-by-row with the other columns?
